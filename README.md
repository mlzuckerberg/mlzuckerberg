# Hi there, I'm Michelle Zuckerberg

## About Me

I am a rising senior at Brandeis University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, with minors in Linguistics and Philosophy. My academic interests lie at the intersection of these disciplines, exploring how computational methods can enhance our understanding of human cognition and behavior. I am passionate about building robust software systems and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

**Current Focus:**

- Completing senior year at Brandeis University
- Software testing and quality assurance at a summer internship
- Advancing expertise in machine learning frameworks and methodologies

**Career Interests:**

- Full-time Software Engineering, ML Engineering, Systems Engineering, or Data Science positions (New Grad 2026)
- Seeking mentorship and professional growth opportunities

## Featured Projects

### Fall AI Studio Project - Coming Soon

---

### Event Discovery and Semantic Relevance Ranking

**Repository:** [event-discovery-semantic-ranking](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/event-discovery-semantic-ranking)

Designed and implemented an MVP solution in Python to automate the discovery and ranking of industry events based on strategic marketing criteria. The system processes JSON inputs, validates data, and employs semantic matching algorithms to score events across multiple dimensions.

**Key Features:**

- Automated event discovery and intelligent ranking system
- JSON input parsing with comprehensive validation
- Multi-criteria scoring algorithm (audience fit, industry relevance, budget constraints)
- Semantic matching using spaCy and scikit-learn

**Technologies:** Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, JSON processing

### Sentiment Analysis Using Dependency Weighting

**Repository:** [sentiment-analysis-dependency-weighting](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/sentiment-analysis-dependency-weighting)

Developed a novel sentiment analysis model that weights word vectors based on their dependency relationships within sentences. The approach achieved improved accuracy over baseline models by leveraging syntactic structure to enhance semantic understanding.

**Key Features:**

- Novel dependency-weighted sentiment analysis algorithm
- Data preprocessing pipeline for 700+ restaurant reviews
- Modular architecture with training, evaluation, and analysis components
- Comprehensive evaluation framework with performance metrics

**Technologies:** Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, pickle serialization

### CLI as GUI - N-gram Command Prediction

**Repository:** [cli-gui-ngram-prediction](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/cli-gui-ngram-prediction)

Developed a three-panel GUI application using JavaSwingLibrary that presents command-line interface functionality with intelligent command prediction. The system utilizes n-gram modeling to provide contextual command suggestions.

**Key Features:**

- Three-panel GUI design with terminal integration
- N-gram prediction model for command suggestions
- Real-time terminal emulation
- Integrated man pages display

**Technologies:** Java, JavaSwingLibrary, N-gram modeling

### RSA Encryption and Digital Signature Protocol

**Repository:** [rsa-encryption-digital-signature](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/rsa-encryption-digital-signature)

Implemented a comprehensive RSA encryption and digital signature system with secure key generation and message processing. The system provides a complete cryptographic solution for secure communication.

**Key Features:**

- RSA key pair generation with prime number validation
- Block-based message encryption and decryption
- Digital signature creation and verification
- Secure message transmission protocol
- Interactive command-line interface with 8 distinct operations
- Extended Euclidean algorithm for modular inverse calculation

**Technologies:** Python, Cryptography, Mathematical algorithms
