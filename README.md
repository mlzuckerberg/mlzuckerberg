## Featured Projects

### Neural-Symbolic Planning: STRIPS Planner

**Repository:** [neural-symbolic-planner](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/neural-symbolic-planner)

Implemented a STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) planner component for solving the classic monkey-banana problem using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language). The planner generates optimal action sequences to achieve goals in symbolic planning domains.

**Key Features:**

- PDDL domain and problem definitions for monkey-banana scenarios
- Integration with Pyperplan for automated planning
- Support for multiple search algorithms (BFS, A*, Greedy Best-First)
- Comprehensive documentation of planning domain and actions
- Example problems with generated solutions

**Technologies:** Python, PDDL, STRIPS Planning, Pyperplan

### Emotional Sentiment Analysis in Social Media

**Repository:** [emotional-sentiment-analysis-social-media](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/emotional-sentiment-analysis-social-media)

R-based statistical analysis exploring the relationship between linguistic features (vocabulary diversity, punctuation frequency) and emotional sentiment expression in social media text using the Sentiment140 dataset.

**Key Features:**

- Correlation analysis between vocabulary diversity and sentiment scores
- Group comparison analysis for punctuation frequency effects
- Data preprocessing pipeline for 3,000+ English-language tweets
- Comprehensive statistical analysis with visualizations
- HTML report with complete findings and interpretations

**Technologies:** R, R Markdown, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization

### Event Discovery and Semantic Relevance Ranking

**Repository:** [event-discovery-semantic-ranking](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/event-discovery-semantic-ranking)

Designed and implemented an MVP solution in Python to automate the discovery and ranking of industry events based on strategic marketing criteria. The system processes JSON inputs, validates data, and employs semantic matching algorithms to score events across multiple dimensions.

**Key Features:**

- Automated event discovery and intelligent ranking system
- JSON input parsing with comprehensive validation
- Multi-criteria scoring algorithm (audience fit, industry relevance, budget constraints)
- Semantic matching using spaCy and scikit-learn

**Technologies:** Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, JSON processing

### Sentiment Analysis Using Dependency Weighting

**Repository:** [sentiment-analysis-dependency-weighting](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/sentiment-analysis-dependency-weighting)

Developed a novel sentiment analysis model that weights word vectors based on their dependency relationships within sentences. The approach achieved improved accuracy over baseline models by leveraging syntactic structure to enhance semantic understanding.

**Key Features:**

- Novel dependency-weighted sentiment analysis algorithm
- Data preprocessing pipeline for 700+ restaurant reviews
- Modular architecture with training, evaluation, and analysis components
- Comprehensive evaluation framework with performance metrics

**Technologies:** Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, pickle serialization

### CLI as GUI - N-gram Command Prediction

**Repository:** [cli-gui-ngram-prediction](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/cli-gui-ngram-prediction)

Developed a three-panel GUI application using JavaSwingLibrary that presents command-line interface functionality with intelligent command prediction. The system utilizes n-gram modeling to provide contextual command suggestions.

**Key Features:**

- Three-panel GUI design with terminal integration
- N-gram prediction model for command suggestions
- Real-time terminal emulation
- Integrated man pages display

**Technologies:** Java, JavaSwingLibrary, N-gram modeling

### RSA Encryption and Digital Signature Protocol

**Repository:** [rsa-encryption-digital-signature](https://github.com/mlzuckerberg/rsa-encryption-digital-signature)

Implemented a comprehensive RSA encryption and digital signature system with secure key generation and message processing. The system provides a complete cryptographic solution for secure communication.

**Key Features:**

- RSA key pair generation with prime number validation
- Block-based message encryption and decryption
- Digital signature creation and verification
- Secure message transmission protocol
- Interactive command-line interface with 8 distinct operations
- Extended Euclidean algorithm for modular inverse calculation

**Technologies:** Python, Cryptography, Mathematical algorithms
